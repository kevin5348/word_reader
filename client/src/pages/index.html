    <p>Manitoba is a province of Canada. Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years.
        In the early 17th century, English and French fur traders arrived and established settlements in the area. The
        Kingdom of England secured control of the region in 1673 and created Rupert's Land, which included present-day
        Manitoba, under the administration of the Hudson's Bay Company. Negotiations for the creation of the province of
        Manitoba.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet, and nephew of King Claudius,
        his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and
        took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet
        slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian
        throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's
        son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.

        On a cold night on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, the sentries Bernardo and Marcellus
        discuss a ghost resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friend
        Horatio as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have
        witnessed.

        The court gathers the next day, and King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly
        adviser Polonius. Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France, and he
        sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also questions Hamlet regarding his
        continuing to grieve for his father, and forbids him to return to his university in Wittenberg. After the court
        exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from
        Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.


        Horatio, Hamlet, and the ghost (Artist: Henry Fuseli, 1789)[5]
        As Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim
        "to thine own self be true."[6] Polonius's daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns
        her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the
        rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, tells the prince that he was murdered by Claudius (by pouring poison into
        his ear as he slept), and demands that Hamlet avenge the murder. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The
        prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to "put an antic disposition on", or act
        as though he has gone mad. Hamlet forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains
        uncertain of the ghost's reliability.

        Act II
        Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and
        behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As
        he enters to do so, the king and queen are welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of
        Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the two students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood
        and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius
        that the king of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The
        forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they
        will pass through Danish territory to get there.

        Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour, and then speaks to Hamlet in a
        hall of the castle to try to learn more. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When
        Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his "friends" warmly but quickly discerns that they are there
        to spy on him for Claudius. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason,
        instead remarking "What a piece of work is a man". Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have
        brought along a troupe of actors that they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors
        and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of King Priam, as
        witnessed by Queen Hecuba, at the climax of the Trojan War. Hamlet then asks the actors to stage The Murder of
        Gonzago, a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder. Hamlet intends to study Claudius's
        reaction to the play, and thereby determine the truth of the ghost's story of Claudius's guilt.
